  introduction: [
    "Arriving in Miami at an early age to pursue their musical dream, frontmen Ivan Lotus and Samuel Little quickly made new friends in The Magic City. Musical prodigies Julian Bermudez and Marcelo Romero joined the band with years of jazz experience alongside virtuoso drummer Marvin Clairsaint.",
    "In 2025, the band recorded their first album titled \"Where is Edgar?\" produced by José Luis \"Cheo\" Pardo—founder, producer, and former member of Los Amigos Invisibles. The album contains songs such as \"CALIENTE\" and \"Paraiso\" that mark a fresh new chapter and define the next era of Lotus Collective.",
    "But it doesn't end here! The band is already working on a new EP, set to be released in 2026. Meanwhile, we still don't know where Edgar is—please help us find him!"
  ],
  philosophy: [
    "Like the lotus flower, the Lotus Collective grows despite its circumstances and believes in always expressing itself in a unique way. In their case, using music as a transformative medium.",
    "The Lotus Collective hand-selected artists from diverse countries and cultural backgrounds to bring a signature, unified sound that represents the essence of Miami, the city they love."

  southPoint: {
    description: [
      "The iconic South Beach park, one of the best places to catch a sunset and experience the breathtaking views of the City of Miami.",
      "As unreal as it may sound, this was once a jamming spot that not only marked the beginnings of Lotus Collective… But also marked a chapter of unprecedented creative expression and vibrant connection for both the band and the Miami Beach community.",
      "However, we felt grateful to have finally found a hub for our music. What began as just a few friends playing for fun soon became our way to connect with a welcoming, expansive audience and to meet both local and international musicians."
    ],
    ban: [
      "After several noise complaints from residents in nearby buildings, live performances in the park were permanently banned by the city.",
      "This separated us from the warm community that had embraced us for so long and left us with an emptiness that later was transformed into inspiration for the song that opens our debut album."

    arrival: [
      "That's when Edgar appeared! He generously offered us his balcony so we could keep our late-night jam sessions alive.",
      "Became the place where the band's best jams took place. Edgar's balcony had a special vibe that kept us motivated, even during moments when everything felt like it was falling apart."
    ],
    disappearance: [
      "Edgar suddenly lost contact with us—he vanished. The being who once radiated mystical energy was now nowhere to be found.",
      "A story that involved the iconic music gatherings at South Point Park, the after-hours jam sessions on Edgar's balcony, our experiences performing and living around Miami, and, of course, the unforgettable disappearance of our mystical friend, Edgar."
