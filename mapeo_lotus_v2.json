            "But also marked a chapter of unprecedented creative expression and vibrant connection for both the band and the Miami Beach community.",
            "However, we felt grateful to have finally found a hub for our music. What began as just a few friends playing for fun soon became our way to connect with a welcoming, expansive audience and to meet both local and international musicians.",
            "After several noise complaints from residents in nearby buildings, live performances in the park were permanently banned by the city.",
            "This separated us from the warm community that had embraced us for so long and left us with an emptiness that later was transformed into inspiration for the song that opens our debut album.",
            "That’s when Edgar appeared! He generously offered us his balcony so we could keep our late-night jam sessions alive.",
            "Became the place where the band’s best jams took place. Edgar’s balcony had a special vibe that kept us motivated, even during moments when everything felt like it was falling apart.",
            "Edgar suddenly lost contact with us—he vanished. The being who once radiated mystical energy was now nowhere to be found.",
            "A story that involved the iconic music gatherings at South Point Park, the after-hours jam sessions on Edgar’s balcony, our experiences performing and living around Miami, and, of course, the unforgettable disappearance of our mystical friend, Edgar.",
            "The mind and mentor behind the production of this debut album—a producer who not only captured our new sound but also chose to feature himself on tracks like Paraíso and South Point",
            "The recording engineer who carefully selected the right musical equipment at Custom Studios to bring even our wildest visions to life.",
            "The creative mind and artist who made the artwork for all the singles of Where Is Edgar?, including the album cover",
            "The mastering engineer who gave our album a perfectly polished final touch.",
            "A soulful, jazzy heartbreak track with a Latin twist. Inspired by the raw emotions of waiting for a love that never arrived, the track captures the heat of passion and the sting of disappointment.",
            "A fusion of jazz, funk, and tropical rhythms, featuring a special guitar performance by Cheo Pardo, resulting in a groove that captures Miami’s carefree charm, warm nights, palm trees, and no-pressure love.",
            "A track that was born in one of the band’s late-night sessions at Miami’s Lotus House. It's a mix of Latin soul with classic funk and modern jazz. The perfect soundtrack for the nocturnal hours.",
            "With sunny rhythms and a subtle bittersweet reflection, it tells the story of a proud mango tree owner who shares his “fruit of gold” with everyone—until the season ends and people lose interest in him.",
            "Our tribute to all those iconic South Point jams. Featuring again the special participation of Cheo Pardo on guitar, it's a track that captures the vibes of those warm Sundays of live music, sunsets, and cultural connection with the community, and also the funky introduction to te album \"Where Is Edgar?\"",
            "The most jazzy song on the album, with undeniable funky and disco elements that give it the dreamy atmosphere that inspired the lyrics.",
            "A Latin fusion track for those loves that feel all-consuming and unreciprocated. It closes the album with some sour lyrics and the participation of Fitasha.",
